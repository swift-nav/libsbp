 * SBP class for message MSG_FILEIO_READ_RESP (0x00A3).

 * <p>The file read message reads a certain length (up to 255 bytes) from a given offset into a
 * file, and returns the data in a message where the message length field indicates how many bytes
 * were successfully read. The sequence number in the response is preserved from the request.
