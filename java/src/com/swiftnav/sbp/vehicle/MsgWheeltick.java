/**
 * SBP class for message MSG_WHEELTICK (0x0904).
 *
 * <p>You can have MSG_WHEELTICK inherent its fields directly from an inherited SBP object, or
 * construct it inline using a dict of its fields.
 *
 * <p>Message containing the accumulated distance travelled by a wheel located at an odometry
 * reference point defined by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and the
 * definition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface. The
 * source of this message is identified by the source field, which is an integer ranging from 0 to
 * 255. The timestamp associated with this message should represent the time when the accumulated
 * tick count reached the value given by the contents of this message as accurately as possible. If
 * using "local CPU time" time tags, the receiving end will expect a `MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a
 * PVT fix becomes available to synchronise wheeltick measurements with GNSS. Local CPU time shall
 * roll over to zero after one week.
