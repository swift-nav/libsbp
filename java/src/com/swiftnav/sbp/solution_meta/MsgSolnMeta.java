/**
 * SBP class for message MSG_SOLN_META (0xFF0E).
 *
 * <p>You can have MSG_SOLN_META inherent its fields directly from an inherited SBP object, or
 * construct it inline using a dict of its fields.
 *
 * <p>This message contains all metadata about the sensors received and/or used in computing the
 * sensorfusion solution. It focuses primarily, but not only, on GNSS metadata. Regarding the age of
 * the last received valid GNSS solution, the highest two bits are time status, indicating whether
 * age gnss can or can not be used to retrieve time of measurement (noted TOM, also known as time of
 * validity) If it can, subtract 'age gnss' from 'tow' in navigation messages to get TOM. Can be
 * used before alignment is complete in the Fusion Engine, when output solution is the last received
 * valid GNSS solution and its tow is not a TOM.
