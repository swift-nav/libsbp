/**
 * SBP class for message MSG_SETTINGS_READ_RESP (0x00A5).
 *
 * <p>You can have MSG_SETTINGS_READ_RESP inherent its fields directly from an inherited SBP object,
 * or construct it inline using a dict of its fields.
 *
 * <p>The setting message with which the device responds after a MSG_SETTING_READ_REQ is sent to
 * device. The string field is a NULL- terminated and NULL-delimited string with contents
 * "SECTION_SETTING\0SETTING\0VALUE\0" where the '\0' escape sequence denotes the NULL character and
 * where quotation marks are omitted. An example string that could be sent from device is
 * "solution\0soln_freq\010\0".
