/** SBP class for message MSG_HEARTBEAT (0xFFFF).
 *
 * You can have MSG_HEARTBEAT inherent its fields directly from
 * an inherited SBP object, or construct it inline using a dict of its
 * fields.
 *
 * The heartbeat message is sent periodically to inform the host
 * or other attached devices that the system is running. It is
 * used to monitor system malfunctions. It also contains status
 * flags that indicate to the host the status of the system and
 * whether it is operating correctly. Currently, the expected
 * heartbeat interval is 1 sec.
 * 
 * The system error flag is used to indicate that an error has
 * occurred in the system. To determine the source of the error,
 * the remaining error flags should be inspected. */
