  Messages for using device's onboard flash filesystem
  functionality. This allows data to be stored persistently in the
  device's program flash with wear-levelling using a simple filesystem
  interface. The file system interface (CFS) defines an abstract API
  for reading directories and for reading and writing files.

  These are in the implementation-defined range (0x0000-0x00FF), and
  intended for internal-use only. Note that some of these messages
  share the same message type ID for both the host request and the
  device response.

definitions:

 - MSG_FILEIO_READ_REQ:
    id: 0x00A8
    short_desc: Read file from the file system (host => device)
    desc: |
      The file read message reads a certain length (up to 255 bytes)
      from a given offset into a file, and returns the data in a
      MSG_FILEIO_READ_RESP message where the message length field
      indicates how many bytes were succesfully read.The sequence
      number in the request will be returned in the response.
    fields:
      - sequence:
          type: u32
          desc: Read sequence number
      - offset:
          type: u32
          units: bytes
          desc: File offset
      - chunk_size:
          type: u8
          units: bytes
          desc: Chunk size to read
      - filename:
          type: string
          desc: Name of the file to read from

 - MSG_FILEIO_READ_RESP:
    id: 0x00A3
    short_desc: File read from the file system (host <= device)
    desc: |
      The file read message reads a certain length (up to 255 bytes)
      from a given offset into a file, and returns the data in a
      message where the message length field indicates how many bytes
      were succesfully read. The sequence number in the response is
      preserved from the request.
    fields:
      - sequence:
          type: u32
          desc: Read sequence number
      - contents:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          desc: Contents of read file

 - MSG_FILEIO_READ_DIR_REQ:
    id: 0x00A9
    short_desc: List files in a directory (host => device)
    desc: |
      The read directory message lists the files in a directory on the
      device's onboard flash file system.  The offset parameter can be
      used to skip the first n elements of the file list. Returns a
      MSG_FILEIO_READ_DIR_RESP message containing the directory
      listings as a NULL delimited list. The listing is chunked over
      multiple SBP packets. The sequence number in the request will be
      returned in the response.
    fields:
      - sequence:
          type: u32
          desc: Read sequence number
      - offset:
          type: u32
          desc: |
            The offset to skip the first n elements of the file list
      - dirname:
          type: string
          desc: Name of the directory to list

 - MSG_FILEIO_READ_DIR_RESP:
    id: 0x00AA
    short_desc: Files listed in a directory (host <= device)
    desc: |
      The read directory message lists the files in a directory on the
      device's onboard flash file system. Message contains the directory
      listings as a NULL delimited list. The listing is chunked over
      multiple SBP packets and the end of the list is identified by an
      entry containing just the character 0xFF. The sequence number in
      the response is preserved from the request.
    fields:
      - sequence:
          type: u32
          desc: Read sequence number
      - contents:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          desc: Contents of read directory

 - MSG_FILEIO_REMOVE:
    id: 0x00AC
    short_desc: Delete a file from the file system (host => device)
    desc: |
      The file remove message deletes a file from the file system.
    fields:
      - filename:
          type: string
          desc: Name of the file to delete

 - MSG_FILEIO_WRITE_REQ:
    id: 0x00AD
    short_desc: Write to file (host => device)
    desc: |
      The file write message writes a certain length (up to 255 bytes)
      of data to a file at a given offset. Returns a copy of the
      original MSG_FILEIO_WRITE_RESP message to check integrity of
      the write. The sequence number in the request will be returned
      in the response.
    fields:
      - sequence:
          type: u32
          desc: Write sequence number
      - offset:
          type: u32
          units: bytes
          desc: Offset into the file at which to start writing in bytes
      - filename:
          type: string
          desc: Name of the file to write to
      - data:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          desc: Variable-length array of data to write

 - MSG_FILEIO_WRITE_RESP:
    id: 0x00AB
    short_desc: File written to (host <= device)
    desc: |
      The file write message writes a certain length (up to 255 bytes)
      of data to a file at a given offset. The message is a copy of the
      original MSG_FILEIO_WRITE_REQ message to check integrity of the
      write. The sequence number in the response is preserved from the
      request.
    fields:
      - sequence:
          type: u32
          desc: Write sequence number
