  Messges for using Piksi's onboard flash filesystem functionality
  from the Contiki project. This allows data to be stored persistently
  in the microcontroller's program flash with wear-levelling using a
  simple filesystem interface. The Contiki file system interface (CFS)
  defines an abstract API for reading directories and for reading and
  writing files. These are in the implementation-defined range
  (0x0000-0x00FF), and intended for internal-use only. Note that some
  of these messages taking a request from a host and a response from
  the Piksi share the same message type ID.

definitions:

 - MSG_FILEIO_READ:
    id: 0x00A8
    public: True
    short_desc: Read file from the file system (Host <=> Piksi).
    desc: |
      The file read message reads a certain length (up to 255 bytes)
      from a given offset into a file, and returns the data in a
      MSG_FILEIO_READ message where the message length field indicates
      how many bytes were succesfully read. If the message is invalid,
      a followup MsgPrint message will print "Invalid fileio read
      message".
    fields:
      - offset:
          type: u32
          units: bytes
          desc: File offset.
      - chunk_size:
          type: u8
          units: bytes
          desc: Chunk size to read.
      - filename:
          type: string
          size: 20
          desc: Name of the file to read from (NULL terminated).

 - MSG_FILEIO_READ_DIR:
    id: 0x00A9
    public: True
    short_desc: List files in a directory (Host <=> Piksi).
    desc: |
      The read directory message lists the files in a directory on the
      Piksi's onboard flash file system.  The offset parameter can be
      used to skip the first n elements of the file list. Returns a
      MSG_FILEIO_READ_DIR message containing the directory listings as
      a NULL delimited list. The listing is chunked over multiple SBP
      packets and the end of the list is identified by an entry
      containing just the character 0xFF. If message is invalid, a
      followup MsgPrint message will print "Invalid fileio read
      message".
    fields:
      - offset:
          type: u32
          desc: |
            The offset to skip the first n elements of the file list.
      - dirname:
          type: string
          size: 20
          desc: Name of the directory to list.

 - MSG_FILEIO_REMOVE:
    id: 0x00AC
    public: True
    short_desc: Delete a file from the file system (Host => Piksi).
    desc: |
      The file remove message deletes a file from the file system. If
      message is invalid, a followup MsgPrint message will print
      "Invalid fileio remove message".
    fields:
      - filename:
          type: string
          size: 20
          desc: Name of the file to delete (NULL terminated)

 - MSG_FILEIO_WRITE:
    id: 0x00AD
    public: True
    short_desc: Write to file (Host <=> Piksi)
    desc: |
      The file write message writes a certain length (up to 255 bytes)
      of data to a file at a given offset. Returns a copy of the
      original MSG_FILEIO_WRITE message to check integrity of the
      write. If message is invalid, a followup MsgPrint message will
      print "Invalid fileio write message".
    fields:
      - filename:
          type: string
          size: 20
          desc: Name of the file to write to (NULL terminated)
      - offset:
          type: u32
          units: bytes
          desc: Offset into the file at which to start writing in bytes
      - data:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          desc: Data to write
