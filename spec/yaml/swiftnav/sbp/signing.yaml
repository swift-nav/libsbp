            desc: >
              Signature message counter. Zero indexed and incremented with each
              signature message.  The counter will not increment if this message
              was in response to an on demand request.  The counter will roll
              over after 256 messages. Upon connection, the value of the counter
              may not initially be zero.
        - on_demand_counter:
            type: u8
            desc: >
              On demand message counter. Zero indexed and incremented with each
              signature message sent in response to an on demand message. The
              counter will roll over after 256 messages.  Upon connection, the
              value of the counter may not initially be zero.

              ECDSA signature for the messages using SHA-256 as the digest
              algorithm.
        - signed_messages:
            type: array
            fill: u8
            desc: >
              CRCs of the messages covered by this signature.  For Skylark,
              which delivers SBP messages wrapped in Swift's proprietary RTCM
              message, these are the 24-bit CRCs from the RTCM message framing.
              For SBP only streams, this will be 16-bit CRCs from the SBP
              framing.  See the `flags` field to determine the type of CRCs
              covered.
