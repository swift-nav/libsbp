 - ObsGPSTime:
    short_desc: Millisecond-accurate GPS time
    desc: |
      A wire-appropriate GPS time, defined as the number of
      milliseconds since beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: Milliseconds since start of GPS week

    short_desc: Header for observation message.
    desc: Header of a GPS observation message.
    fields:
        - t:
            type: ObsGPSTime
            desc: GPS time of this observation
        - n_obs:
            type: u8
            desc: |
              Total number of observations. First nibble is the size
              of the sequence (n), second nibble is the zero-indexed
              counter (ith packet of n)

 - PackedObsContent:
    short_desc: GPS observations for a particular satellite signal.
    desc: |
      Pseudorange and carrier phase observation for a satellite being
      tracked. The observations should be interoperable with 3rd party 
      receivers and conform with typical RTCMv3 GNSS observations. 
    fields:
        - P:
            type: u32
            units: 2 cm
            desc: Pseudorange observation
        - L:
            type: s32
            units: 0.5 mm
            desc: |
                  Phase Range minus pseudorange. Phaserange can be reconstructed
                  by adding pseudorange to this value. This follows the convention
                  from DF0012 or the DF042 field from the RTCM 10403.2 Ammendment 2
                  specification.  Importantly, this assumes the phaserange has the 
                  same sign as the pseudorange.
        - cn0:
            type: u8
            units: dB Hz * 4
            desc: Carrier-to-Noise density
        - lock:
            type: u8
            desc: |
              Lock indicator. This value gives an indication of the time
              for which a satellite has maintained continuous phase lock.
              Whenever a satellite signal has lost and regained lock, this 
              value is reset to zero. It is encoded according to DF402 from
              the RTCM 10403.2 Amendment 2 specification.  Given a lock time (t)
              in milliseconds, the field value (n) is given by floor(log_2(t) - 4) 
              when t is greater than 32 ms or 0 if (t) is less than 32 ms. 
              Conversely, given the field, n,  the lower range of possible  lock times
              is given by 2 ^ (n + 4) ms and the upper range is given by 2 ^ (n + 5) ms
              provided n is not 0.  If n is 0 the lower range is given to be 0 ms.

    short_desc: GPS satellite observations
    desc: |
      The GPS observations message reports all the raw pseudorange and
      carrier phase observations for the satellites being tracked by
      the device. Carrier phase observation here is phaserange - pseudorange.
      The observations should be interoperable with 3rd party receivers and conform 
      with typical RTCMv3 GNSS observations.

    short_desc: Base station position
    desc: |
      The base station position message is the position reported by
      the base station itself. It is used for pseudo-absolute RTK
      positioning, and is required to be a high-accuracy surveyed
      location of the base station. Any error here will result in an
      error in the pseudo-absolute position output.

    short_desc: Base station position in ECEF
    desc: |
      The base station position message is the position reported by
      the base station itself in absolute Earth Centered Earth Fixed
      coordinates. It is used for pseudo-absolute RTK positioning, and
      is required to be a high-accuracy surveyed location of the base
      station. Any error here will result in an error in the
      pseudo-absolute position output.

 - MSG_EPHEMERIS:
    id: 0x0080
    short_desc: Satellite broadcast ephemeris
    desc: |
      The ephemeris message returns a set of satellite orbit
      parameters that is used to calculate GPS satellite position,
      velocity, and clock offset. Please see the Navstar GPS
      Space Segment/Navigation user interfaces (ICD-GPS-200, Table

      should be used for observations referenced to

      This ephemeris message has been deprecated to allow the ephemerides
      to be masked separately from GNSS observations.
      The ephemeris message returns a set of satellite orbits
      parameters that is used to calculate GPS satellite position,
      velocity, and clock offset. Please see the Navstar GPS
      Space Segment/Navigation user interfaces (ICD-GPS-200, Table
      20-III) for more details.
