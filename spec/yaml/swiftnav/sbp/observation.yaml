    desc: |
      The GPS observations message reports all the raw pseudorange and
      carrier phase observations for the satellites being tracked by
      the device. Carrier phase observation here is represented as a
      40-bit fixed point number with Q32.8 layout (i.e. 32-bits of

    id: 0x0044
    short_desc: Base station position
    desc: |
      The base station position message is the position reported by
      the base station itself. It is used for pseudo-absolute RTK
      positioning, and is required to be a high-accuracy surveyed
      location of the base station. Any error here will result in an
      error in the pseudo-absolute position output.

      The ephemeris message returns a set of satellite orbit
      parameters that is used to calculate GPS satellite position,
      velocity, and clock offset. Please see the Navstar GPS
      Space Segment/Navigation user interfaces (ICD-GPS-200, Table
      20-III) for more details.
