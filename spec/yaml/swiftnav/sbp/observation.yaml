definitions:

 - ObsGPSTime:
    public: True
    short_desc: Millisecond-accurate GPS time
    desc: |
      A wire-appropriate GPS time, defined as the number of
      milliseconds since beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: Milliseconds since start of GPS week
        - wn:
            type: u16
            units: week
            desc: GPS week number

 - CarrierPhase:
    public: True
    short_desc: GPS carrier phase measurement.
    desc: |
      Carrier phase measurement in cycles represented as a 40-bit
      fixed point number with Q32.8 layout, i.e. 32-bits of whole
      cycles and 8-bits of fractional cycles.
    fields:
        - i:
            type: s32
            units: cycles
            desc: Carrier phase whole cycles
        - f:
            type: u8
            units: cycles / 255
            desc: Carrier phase fractional part

 - ObservationHeader:
    public: True
    short_desc: Header for observation message.
    desc: Header of a GPS observation message.
    fields:
        - t:
            type: ObsGPSTime
            desc: GPS time of this observation
        - n_obs:
            type: u8
            desc: |
              Total number of observations. First nibble is the size
              of the sequence (n), second nibble is the zero-indexed
              counter (ith packet of n)

 - PackedObsContent:
    public: True
    short_desc: GPS observations for a particular satellite signal.
    desc: |
      Pseudorange and carrier phase observation for a satellite being
      tracked.
    fields:
        - P:
            type: u32
            units: cm
            desc: Pseudorange observation
        - L:
            type: CarrierPhase
            desc: Carrier phase observation
        - cn0:
            type: u8
            units: dB Hz
            desc: Carrier-to-Noise density
        - lock:
            type: u16
            desc: |
              Lock indicator. This value changes whenever a satellite
              signal has lost and regained lock, indicating that the
              carrier phase ambiguity may have changed. There is no
              significance to the value of the lock indicator
        - prn:
            type: u8
            desc: PRN identifier of the satellite signal

 - MSG_OBS:
    id: 0x0045
    public: True
    short_desc: GPS satellite observations
    desc: |
      The GPS observations message reports all the pseudo range and
      carrier phase observations for the satellites being tracked by
      the Piksi.
    fields:
        - header:
            type: ObservationHeader
            desc: Header of a GPS observation message

              Pseudorange and carrier phase observation for a
              satellite being tracked

 - MSG_BASE_POS:
    id: 0x0044
    public: True
    short_desc: Base station position

      This may be the position as reported by the base station itself or the
      position obtained from doing a single point solution using the base
      station observations.
    fields:
        - lat:
            type: double
            units: deg
