        The heartbeat message is sent periodically to inform the host
        or other attached devices that the system is running. It is
        used to monitor system malfunctions. It also contains status
        flags that indicate to the host the status of the system and
        whether it is operating correctly. Currently, the expected
        heartbeat interval is 1 sec.


        The system error flag is used to indicate that an error has
        occurred in the system. To determine the source of the error,
        the remaining error flags should be inspected.

        Interpretation of the subsystem specific status code is product

 - MSG_PPS_TIME:

    desc: >
      The PPS time message contains the value of the sender's local time in
      microseconds at the moment a pulse is detected on the PPS input. This
      is to be used for syncronisation of sensor data sampled with a local
      timestamp (e.g. IMU or wheeltick messages) where GNSS time is unknown
      to the sender.


      The local time used to timestamp the PPS pulse must be generated by the
      same clock which is used to timestamp the IMU/wheel sensor data and
      should follow the same roll-over rules.  A separate MSG_PPS_TIME
      message should be sent for each source of sensor data which uses
      PPS-relative timestamping.  The sender ID for each of these
      MSG_PPS_TIME messages should match the sender ID of the respective
      sensor data.
