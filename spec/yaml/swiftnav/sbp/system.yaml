    short_desc: System heartbeat message

        The heartbeat message is sent periodically to inform the host
        or other attached devices that the system is running. It is
        used to monitor system malfunctions. It also contains status
        flags that indicate to the host the status of the system and
        whether it is operating correctly. Currently, the expected
        heartbeat interval is 1 sec.

        The system error flag is used to indicate that an error has
        occurred in the system. To determine the source of the error,
        the remaining error flags should be inspected.
