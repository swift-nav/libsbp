  - types.yaml
definitions:

 - MSG_STARTUP:
    id: 0xFF00
    public: True
    short_desc: System start-up message
    desc: |
        The system start-up message is sent once on system
        start-up. It is intended to be used to notify the host or
        other attached devices that the system has started and is now
        ready to respond to commands or configuration requests.
    fields:
        - reserved:
            type: u32
            desc: Reserved

 - MSG_HEARTBEAT:
    id: 0xFFFF
    public: True
    short_desc: System heartbeat message
    desc: |
        The heartbeat message is sent periodically to inform the host
        or other attached devices that the system is running. It is
        intended to be used to monitor for system malfunctions and
        also contains status flags that indicate to the host the
        status of the system and if it is operating correctly.

        The system error flag is used to indicate that an error has
        occurred in the system. To determine the source of the error
        the remaining error flags should be inspected.
    fields:
        - flags:
            type: u32
