description: Messages from a vehicle.
stable: False
public: True
definitions:

 - MSG_ODOMETRY:
    id: 0x0903
    short_desc: Vehicle forward (x-axis) velocity
    desc: |
      Message representing the x component of vehicle velocity in the user frame at the odometry
      reference point(s) specified by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and 
      the definition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface.
      There are 4 possible user-defined sources of this message  which are labeled arbitrarily 
      source 0 through 3.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: |
             Time field representing either milliseconds in the GPS Week or local CPU
             time from the producing system in milliseconds.  See the tow_source flag
             for the exact source of this timestamp.
        - velocity:
           type: s32
           units: mm/s
           desc: |
             The signed forward component of vehicle velocity.
        - flags:
            type: u8
            desc: Status flags
            fields:
                  - 5-7:
                      desc: Reserved
                  - 3-4:
                      desc: Velocity Source
                      values:
                          - 0: Source 0
                          - 1: Source 1
                          - 2: Source 2
                          - 3: Source 3
                  - 0-2:
                      desc: Time source
                      values:
                          - 0: None (invalid)
                          - 1: GPS Solution (ms in week)
                          - 2: Processor Time

 - MSG_WHEELTICK:
    id: 0x0904
    short_desc: Accumulated wheeltick count message
    desc: |
      Message containing the accumulated distance travelled by a wheel located at an odometry
      reference point defined by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and the
      definition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface.
      The source of this message is identified by the source field, which is an integer ranging
      from 0 to 255.
      The timestamp associated with this message should represent the time when the accumulated
      tick count reached the value given by the contents of this message as accurately as possible.
    fields:
        - time:
            type: u64
            units: us
            desc: |
             Time field representing either microseconds since the last PPS, microseconds in the GPS
             Week or local CPU time from the producing system in microseconds. See the synch_type
             field for the exact meaning of this timestamp.
        - flags:
            type: u8
            desc: |
              Field indicating the type of timestamp contained in the time field.
            fields:
                  - 2-7:
                      desc: Reserved
                  - 0-1:
                      desc: Synchronization type
                      values:
                          - 0: microseconds since last PPS
                          - 1: microseconds in GPS week
                          - 2: local CPU time in nominal microseconds
        - source:
            type: u8
            desc: |
              ID of the sensor producing this message
        - ticks:
            type: s32
            units: arbitrary distance units
            desc: |
              Free-running counter of the accumulated distance for this sensor. The counter should be
              incrementing if travelling into one direction and decrementing when travelling in the
              opposite direction.
