 - MSG_TRACKING_STATE:
    id: 0x0013
    short_desc: Satellite tracking channel states
    desc: |
      The tracking message returns a variable-length array of tracking
      channel states. It reports status and snr power measurements for
      all tracked satellites.

    short_desc: Complex correlation structure
    desc: |
      Structure containing in-phase and quadrature correlation components.
    fields:
        - I:

 - MSG_TRACKING_IQ:
    id: 0x001C
    short_desc: Tracking channel correlations
    desc: |
      When enabled, a tracking channel can output the correlations at each
      update interval.
