              Signal identifier being tracked - values 0x00 through 0x1F
              represent GPS PRNs 1 through 32 respectively (PRN-1 notation);
              other values reserved for future use

    id: 0x0013
    short_desc: Satellite tracking channel states
    desc: |
      The tracking message returns a variable-length array of tracking
      channel states. It reports status and snr power measurements for
      all tracked satellites.
