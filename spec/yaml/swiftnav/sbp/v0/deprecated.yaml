 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_DEPRECATED:
    id: 0x00B0
    public: True
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake response (host <= device)
    desc: |
      The handshake message response from the device establishes a
      handshake between the device bootloader and the host. The
      request from the host is MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_HOST.  The
      payload string contains the bootloader version number, but
      returns an empty string for earlier versions.
