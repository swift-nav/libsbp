package: swiftnav.sbp.bootload
description: |
  Messages for the bootloading configuration on the device.

  These are in the implementation-defined range (0x0000-0x00FF), and
  are intended for internal use only. Note that some of these messages
  share the same message type ID for both the host request and the
  device response.

definitions:

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_HOST:
    id: 0x00B3
    public: True
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake request (host => device)
    desc: |
      The handshake message request from the host establishes a
      handshake between the device bootloader and the host. The
      response from the device is MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_DEVICE.

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_DEVICE:
    id: 0x00B4
    public: True
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake response (host <= device)
    desc: |
      The handshake message response from the device establishes a
      handshake between the device bootloader and the host. The
      request from the host is MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_HOST.  The
      payload contains the bootloader version number and the SBP
      protocol version number.
    fields:
      - flags:
          type: u32
          desc: Bootloader flags
          fields:
            - 16-31:
                desc: Reserved
            - 8-15:
                desc: SBP major protocol version number
            - 0-7:
                desc: SBP minor protocol version number
      - version:
          type: string
          desc: Bootloader version number

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_JUMP_TO_APP:
    id: 0x00B1
    public: False
    short_desc: Bootloader jump to application (host => device)
    desc: |
      The host initiates the bootloader to jump to the application.
    fields:
      - jump:
          type: u8
          desc: Ignored by the device

 - MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_HOST:
    id: 0x00DE
    public: True
    short_desc: Read FPGA device ID over UART request (host => device)
    desc: |
      The device message from the host reads a unique device
      identifier from the SwiftNAP, an FPGA. The host requests the ID
      by sending a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_HOST message. The device
      responds with a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_DEVICE message with the
      device ID in the payload. Note that this ID is tied to the FPGA,
      and not related to the Piksi's serial number.

 - MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_DEVICE:
    id: 0x00DD
    public: True
    short_desc: Read FPGA device ID over UART response (host <= device)
    desc: |
      The device message from the host reads a unique device
      identifier from the SwiftNAP, an FPGA. The host requests the ID
      by sending a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_HOST message. The device
      responds with a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_DEVICE messagage with the
      device ID in the payload. Note that this ID is tied to the FPGA,
      and not related to the Piksi's serial number.
    fields:
      - dna:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          size: 8
          desc: |
            57-bit SwiftNAP FPGA Device ID. Remaining bits are padded
            on the right.
