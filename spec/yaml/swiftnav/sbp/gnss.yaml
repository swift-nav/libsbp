            desc: |
                Constellation-specific satellite identifier. This field for Glonass can  
                either be (100+FCN) where FCN is in [-7,+6] or

 - SvId:
    short_desc: Space vehicle identifier
    desc: |
      A (Constellation ID, satellite ID) tuple that uniquely identifies
      a space vehicle
    fields:
    - satId:
        type: u8
        desc: ID of the space vehicle within its constellation
    - constellation:
        type: u8
        desc: Constellation ID to which the SV belongs

 - GnssSignalDep:
    short_desc: Deprecated
    desc: Deprecated.
    fields:
        - sat:
            type: u16
            desc: |
                Constellation-specific satellite identifier.

                Note: unlike GnssSignal, GPS satellites are encoded as
                (PRN - 1). Other constellations do not have this offset.
        - code:
            type: u8
            desc: Signal constellation, band and code

    short_desc: Millisecond-accurate GPS time

      milliseconds since beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition.

      A GPS time, defined as the number of
      seconds since beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition.

 - GPSTime:
    short_desc: Nanosecond-accurate receiver clock time
    desc: |
      A wire-appropriate receiver clock time, defined as the time
      since the beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition. In most cases, observations are epoch aligned
      so ns field will be 0.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: Milliseconds since start of GPS week

              Nanosecond residual of millisecond-rounded TOW (ranges
              from -500000 to 500000)

            units: week
            desc: GPS week number

 - CarrierPhase:
      short_desc: GNSS carrier phase measurement.
      desc: |
        Carrier phase measurement in cycles represented as a 40-bit
        fixed point number with Q32.8 layout, i.e. 32-bits of whole
        cycles and 8-bits of fractional cycles. This phase has the
        same sign as the pseudorange.
      fields:
          - i:
              type: s32
              units: cycles

          - f:
              type: u8
              units: cycles / 256
              desc: Carrier phase fractional part
