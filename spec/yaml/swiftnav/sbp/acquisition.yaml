 - MSG_ACQ_RESULT:
    id: 0x001F
    short_desc: Satellite acquisition result
    desc: |
      This message describes the results from an attempted GPS signal
      acquisition search for a satellite PRN over a code phase/carrier
      frequency range. It contains the parameters of the point in the
      acquisition search space with the best carrier-to-noise (CN/0)
      ratio.
