    short_desc: Satellite acquisition result
    desc: |
      This message describes the results from an attempted GPS signal
      acquisition search for a satellite PRN over a code phase/carrier
      frequency range. It contains the parameters of the point in the
      acquisition search space with the best signal-to-noise (SNR)
      ratio.
    fields:
        - snr:
            type: float
            desc: |
              SNR of best point. Currently in arbitrary SNR points, but will
              be in units of dB Hz in a later revision of this message.

              Signal identifier of the satellite signal for which acquisition
              was attempted - values 0x00 through 0x1F represent GPS PRNs 1
              through 32 respectively (PRN-minus-1 notation); other values reserved
              for future use.
