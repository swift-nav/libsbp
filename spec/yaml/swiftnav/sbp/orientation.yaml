 - MSG_BASELINE_HEADING:
    id: 0x020F
    short_desc: Heading relative to True North
    desc: |
      This message reports the baseline heading pointing from the base station
      to the rover relative to True North. The full GPS time is given by the
      preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow). It is intended
      that time-matched RTK mode is used when the base station is moving.

 - MSG_ORIENT_QUAT:

    short_desc: Quaternion 4 component vector 
    desc: |
      This message reports the quaternion vector describing the vehicle body frame's orientation
      with respect to a local-level NED frame. The components of the vector should sum to a unit
      vector assuming that the LSB of each component as a value of 2^-31. This message will only
      be available in future INS versions of Swift Products and is not produced by Piksi Multi 
      or Duro.

 - MSG_ORIENT_EULER:
    id: 0x0221
    short_desc:  Euler angles
    desc: |
      This message reports the yaw, pitch, and roll angles of the vehicle body frame.
      The rotations should applied intrinsically in the order yaw, pitch, and roll 
      in order to rotate the from a frame aligned with the local-level NED frame 
      to the vehicle body frame.  This message will only be available in future 
      INS versions of Swift Products and is not produced by Piksi Multi or Duro.

 - MSG_ANGULAR_RATE:
    id: 0x0222
    short_desc: Vehicle Body Frame instantaneous angular rates
    desc: |
      This message reports the orientation rates in the vehicle body frame. 
      The values represent the measurements a strapped down gyroscope would 
      make and are not equivalent to the time derivative of the Euler angles.
      The orientation and origin of the user frame is specified via device settings.
      By convention, the vehicle x-axis is expected to be aligned with the forward
      direction, while the vehicle y-axis is expected to be aligned with the right
      direction, and the vehicle z-axis should be aligned with the down direction.
      This message will only be available in future INS versions of Swift Products 
      and is not produced by Piksi Multi or Duro.
