 - MSG_BASELINE_HEADING:
    id: 0x020F
    short_desc: Heading relative to True North
    desc: |
      This message reports the baseline heading pointing from the base station
      to the rover relative to True North. The full GPS time is given by the
      preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow). It is intended
      that time-matched RTK mode is used when the base station is moving.

      This message reports the yaw, pitch, and roll angles of the vehicle body frame.
      The rotations should applied intrinsically in the order yaw, pitch, and roll 
      in order to rotate the from a frame aligned with hte local-level NED frame 
      to the vehicle body frame.

 - MSG_ANGULAR_RATE:
    id: 0x0222
    short_desc: User Frame instantaneous angular rates
    desc: |
      This message reports the orientation rates in the user body frame. 
      The values represent the measurements a strapped down gyroscope would 
      make and are not equivalent to the time derivative of the Euler angles.
      The orientation and origin of the user frame is specified via device settings.
      By convention, the vehicle x-axis is expected to be aligned with the forward
      direction, while the vehicle y-axis is expected to be aligned with the right
      direction, and the vehicle z-axis should be aligned with the down direction.
