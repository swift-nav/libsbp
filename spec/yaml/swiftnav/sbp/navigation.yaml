  Geodetic navigation messages reporting GPS time, position, velocity,
  and baseline position solutions. For position solutions, these
  messages define several different position solutions: single-point
  (SPP), RTK, and pseudo-absolute position solutions.

  The SPP is the standalone, absolute GPS position solution using only
  a single receiver. The RTK solution is the differential GPS
  solution, which can use either a fixed/integer or floating carrier
  phase ambiguity. The pseudo-absolute position solution uses a
  user-provided, well-surveyed base station position (if available)
  and the RTK solution in tandem.

  When the inertial navigation mode indicates that the IMU is used,
  all messages are reported in the vehicle body frame as defined by
  device settings.  By default, the vehicle body frame is configured to be
  coincident with the antenna phase center.  When there is no inertial
  navigation, the solution will be reported at the phase center of the antenna.
  There is no inertial navigation capability on Piksi Multi or Duro.

 - MSG_GPS_TIME:
    id: 0x0102
    short_desc: GPS Time
    desc: |
      This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
      the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.

      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
      these messages.

      of the position solution as well as the upper triangle of the 3x3

    desc: |
      The position solution message reports absolute Earth Centered
      Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates and the status (single point vs
      pseudo-absolute RTK) of the position solution. The message also
      reports the upper triangular portion of the 3x3 covariance matrix.
      If the receiver knows the surveyed position of the base station and has
      an RTK solution, this reports a pseudo-absolute position
      solution using the base station position and the rover's RTK
      baseline vector. The full GPS time is given by the preceding
      MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow).

      This position solution message reports the absolute geodetic
      coordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK)
      of the position solution as well as the upper triangle of the 3x3
      covariance matrix.  The position information and Fix Mode flags should
      follow the MSG_POS_LLH message.  Since the covariance matrix is computed
      in the local-level North, East, Down frame, the covariance terms follow
      with that convention. Thus, covariances are reported against the "downward"
      measurement and care should be taken with the sign convention.

      This message reports the velocity in the Vehicle Body Frame. By convention,
      the x-axis should point out the nose of the vehicle and represent the forward
      direction, while as the y-axis should point out the right hand side of the vehicle.
      Since this is a right handed system, z should point out the bottom of the vehicle.
      The orientation and origin of the Vehicle Body Frame are specified via the device settings.
      The full GPS time is given by the preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the
      matching time-of-week (tow). This message is only produced by inertial versions of Swift

      This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
      the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.

      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
      these messages.
