  Geodetic navigation messages reporting GPS time, position, velocity,
  and baseline position solutions. For position solutions, these
  messages define several different position solutions: single-point
  (SPP), RTK, and pseudo-absolute position solutions.

  The SPP is the standalone, absolute GPS position solution using only
  a single receiver. The RTK solution is the differential GPS
  solution, which can use either a fixed/integer or floating carrier
  phase ambiguity. The pseudo-absolute position solution uses a
  user-provided, well-surveyed base station position (if available)
  and the RTK solution in tandem.

 - MSG_GPS_TIME:
    id: 0x0100
    short_desc: GPS Time
    desc: |
      This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
      the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.

      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
      these messages.

 - MSG_POS_ECEF:

    desc: |
      The position solution message reports absolute Earth Centered
      Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates and the status (single point vs
      pseudo-absolute RTK) of the position solution. If the rover
      receiver knows the surveyed position of the base station and has
      an RTK solution, this reports a pseudo-absolute position
      solution using the base station position and the rover's RTK
      baseline vector. The full GPS time is given by the preceding
      MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow).

      This position solution message reports the absolute geodetic

      of the position solution. If the rover receiver knows the
