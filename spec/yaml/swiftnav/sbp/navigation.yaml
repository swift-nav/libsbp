  Geodetic navigation messages reporting GPS time, position, velocity,
  and baseline position solutions. For position solutions, these
  messages define several different position solutions: single-point
  (SPP), RTK, and pseudo-absolute position solutions.

  The SPP is the standalone, absolute GPS position solution using only
  a single receiver. The RTK solution is the differential GPS
  solution, which can use either a fixed/integer or floating carrier
  phase ambiguity. The pseudo-absolute position solution uses a
  user-provided, well-surveyed base station position (if available)
  and the RTK solution in tandem.

 - MSG_GPS_TIME:
    id: 0x0102
    short_desc: GPS Time
    desc: |
      This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
      the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.

      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
      these messages.

      This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
      the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.

      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
      these messages.
