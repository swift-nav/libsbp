  Messages for reading/writing the device's onboard flash memory. Many
  of these messages target specific flash memory peripherals used in
  Swift Navigation devices: the STM32 flash and the M25Pxx FPGA
  configuration flash.

  These are in the implementation-defined range (0x0000-0x00FF), and
  are intended for internal-use only.

 - MSG_FLASH_PROGRAM:
    id: 0x00E6
    short_desc: Program flash addresses
    desc: |
      The flash program message programs a set of addresses of either
      the STM or M25 flash. The device replies with either a
      MSG_FLASH_DONE message containing the return code FLASH_OK (0)
      on success, or FLASH_INVALID_LEN (2) if the maximum write size
      is exceeded. Note that the sector-containing addresses must be
      erased before addresses can be programmed.

      MSG_FLASH_PROGRAM, may return this message on failure.
