description: >
  Messages for the bootloading configuration of a Piksi 2.3.1.  This message
  group does not apply to Piksi Multi.


  Note that some of these messages share the same message type ID for both the
  host request and the device response.
stable: True
public: False

  - types.yaml
definitions:

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_REQ:
    id: 0x00B3
    public: false
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake request (host => device)
    desc: >
      The handshake message request from the host establishes a
      handshake between the device bootloader and the host. The
      response from the device is MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_RESP.
 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_RESP:
    id: 0x00B4
    public: false
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake response (host <= device)
    desc: >
      The handshake message response from the device establishes a
      handshake between the device bootloader and the host. The
      request from the host is MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_REQ.  The
      payload contains the bootloader version number and the SBP
      protocol version number.
    fields:
      - flags:
          type: u32
          desc: Bootloader flags
          fields:
            - 16-31:
                desc: Reserved
            - 8-15:
                desc: SBP major protocol version number
            - 0-7:
                desc: SBP minor protocol version number
      - version:
          type: string
          encoding: unterminated
          desc: Bootloader version number

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_JUMP_TO_APP:
    id: 0x00B1
    public: false
    short_desc: Bootloader jump to application (host => device)
    desc: >
      The host initiates the bootloader to jump to the application.
    fields:
      - jump:
          type: u8
          desc: Ignored by the device

 - MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_REQ:
    id: 0x00DE
    public: false
    short_desc: Read FPGA device ID over UART request (host => device)
    desc: >
      The device message from the host reads a unique device
      identifier from the SwiftNAP, an FPGA. The host requests the ID
      by sending a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_REQ message. The device
      responds with a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_RESP message with the
      device ID in the payload. Note that this ID is tied to the FPGA,
      and not related to the Piksi's serial number.

 - MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_RESP:
    id: 0x00DD
    public: false
    short_desc: Read FPGA device ID over UART response (host <= device)
    desc: >
      The device message from the host reads a unique device
      identifier from the SwiftNAP, an FPGA. The host requests the ID
      by sending a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_REQ message. The device
      responds with a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA_RESP message with the
      device ID in the payload. Note that this ID is tied to the FPGA,
      and not related to the Piksi's serial number.

          size: 8
          desc: >
            57-bit SwiftNAP FPGA Device ID. Remaining bits are padded
            on the right.

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE_DEP_A:
    id: 0x00B0
    public: false
    short_desc: Deprecated
    desc: Deprecated.
