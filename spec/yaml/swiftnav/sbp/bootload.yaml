package: swiftnav.sbp.bootload
description: |
  Messages for the bootloading configuration on the Piksi. These are
  in the implementation-defined range (0x0000-0x00FF), and intended
  for internal-use only. Note that some of these messages taking a
  request from a host and a response from the Piksi share the same
  message type ID.
stable: False
public: True
include:
  - types.yaml
definitions:

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE:
    id: 0x00B0
    public: True
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake (Host <=> Piksi).
    desc: |
      The bootloader continually sends a handshake message to the host
      for a short period of time, and then jumps to the firmware if it
      doesn't receive a handshake from the host. If the host replies
      with a handshake the bootloader doesn't jump to the firmware and
      nwaits for flash programming messages, and the host has to send a
      MSG_BOOTLOADER_JUMP_TO_APP when it's done programming. On old
      versions of the bootloader (<=v0.1), hardcoded u8=0. On new
      versions, return the git describe string for the bootloader
      build.
    fields:
      - handshake:
          type: u8
          desc: Handshake value

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_JUMP_TO_APP:
    id: 0x00B1
    public: True
    short_desc: Bootloader jump to application (Host => Piksi)
    desc: |
      The host initiates the bootloader to jump to the application.
    fields:
      - jump:
          type: u8
          desc: Ignored by the Piksi.

 - MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA:
    id: 0x00DD
    public: True
    short_desc: Send FPGA device DNA over UART (Host <=> Piksi).
    desc: |
      The device DNA message from the host reads the unique device
      DNA from the Swift Navigation Acceleration Peripheral
      (SwiftNAP), a Spartan 6 FPGA. By convention, the host message
      buffer is empty; the Piksi returns the device DNA in a
      MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA message.
    fields:
      - dna:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          size: 8
          desc: 57-bit SwiftNAP FPGA Device DNA
