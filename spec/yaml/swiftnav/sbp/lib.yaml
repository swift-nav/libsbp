definitions:

 - Latency:
    desc: |
      Statistics on the latency of observations received from the base
      station. As observation packets are received their GPS time is
      compared to the current GPS time calculated locally by the
      receiver to give a precise measurement of the end-to-end
      communication latency in the system.
    fields:
        - avg:
            type: s32
            units: ms
            desc: Average latency.
        - lmin:
            type: s32
            units: ms
            desc: Minimum latency.
        - lmax:
            type: s32
            units: ms
            desc: Maximum latency.
        - current:
            type: s32
            units: ms
            desc: Smoothed estimate of the current latency.

 - CarrierPhase:
    desc: |
      Carrier phase measurement in cycles represented as a 40-bit
      fixed point number with Q32.8 layout, i.e. 32-bits of whole
      cycles and 8-bits of fractional cycles.
    fields:
        - i:
            type: s32
            units: cycles
            desc: Carrier phase whole cycles.
        - f:
            type: u8
            units: cycles / 255
            desc: Carrier phase fractional part.
