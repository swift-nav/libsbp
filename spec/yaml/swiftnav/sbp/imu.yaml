 - MSG_IMU_RAW:
    id: 0x0900
    short_desc: Raw IMU data
    desc: >
      Raw data from the Inertial Measurement Unit, containing accelerometer and
      gyroscope readings. The sense of the measurements are to be aligned with
      the indications on the device itself. Measurement units, which are specific to the
      device hardware and settings, are communicated via the MSG_IMU_AUX message.
      If using "time since startup" time tags, the receiving end will expect a
      `MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a PVT fix becomes available to synchronise IMU measurements
      with GNSS. The timestamp must wrap around to zero when reaching one week (604800 seconds).


      The time-tagging mode should not change throughout a run.

 - MSG_IMU_HIGH_RATE_DATA:
    id: 0x0905
    short_desc: IMU data
    desc: >
      This message contains timestamped high rate IMU data, i.e. acceleration and angular rate, as well as high-rate
      status and health information.

      If multiple IMUs are being sent from the same sender ID, they shall use different imu_id values.
      When the physical IMU changes that's the source of the data (e.g. after a replacement of an ECU), then this
      shall also result in using a different imu_id for the new IMU.

      Timestamps can either be the GNSS time of week (wrapping around to zero after 604800 seconds) or a monotonic
      local time (wrapping around to zero after 2^32 milliseconds). The timestamping mode shall be reported as part
      of the status flags. When monotonic, local time is being used, all IMUs from the same sender ID must use the
      same monotonic clock and the relation to GNSS time needs to be established using either MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET
      or MSG_PPS_TIME fom the same sender ID.

      The time-tagging mode should not change throughout a run.

 - MSG_IMU_LOW_RATE_DATA:
    id: 0x0906
    short_desc: Low rate IMU data
    desc: >
      This message contains low-rate IMU meta-information like the type of the IMU that is being used,
      temperature and extended status information.

      The temperature field is a temperature difference from -60 degrees Celsius in 0.004 degree increments
      - i.e. a value of 1 would mean a temperature of -59.996 degrees Celsius. An invalid or unavailable
      temperature shall be denoted by a value of 0xFF

      The flags field  contains high level status information just as the high rate IMU data but contains
      additional space for more extensive status information. The usage of these reserved status bits depend
      on the actual IMU model being used. Details can be found in the respective integration manual.
    fields:
        - imu_id:
            type: u8
            desc: Identifier of current IMU, e.g. to differentiate between multiple IMUs in the same vehicle
