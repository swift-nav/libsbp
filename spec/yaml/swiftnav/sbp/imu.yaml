description: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) messages.

 - MSG_IMU_RAW:
    id: 0x0900
    short_desc: Raw IMU data
    desc: |
      Raw data from the Inertial Measurement Unit, containing accelerometer and
      gyroscope readings. The sense of the measurements are to be aligned with 
      the indications on the device itself. Measurement units, which are specific to the
      device hardware and settings, are communicated via the MSG_IMU_AUX message.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: |
              Milliseconds since start of GPS week. If the high bit is set, the
              time is unknown or invalid.
        - tow_f:
            type: u8
            units: ms / 256
            desc: |
              Milliseconds since start of GPS week, fractional part
        - acc_x:
            type: s16
            desc: Acceleration in the IMU frame X axis
        - acc_y:
            type: s16
            desc: Acceleration in the IMU frame Y axis
        - acc_z:
            type: s16
            desc: Acceleration in the IMU frame Z axis
        - gyr_x:
            type: s16
            desc: Angular rate around IMU frame X axis
        - gyr_y:
            type: s16
            desc: Angular rate around IMU frame Y axis
        - gyr_z:
            type: s16
            desc: Angular rate around IMU frame Z axis

 - MSG_IMU_AUX:
    id: 0x0901
    short_desc: Auxiliary IMU data
    desc: |
      Auxiliary data specific to a particular IMU. The `imu_type` field will
      always be consistent but the rest of the payload is device specific and
      depends on the value of `imu_type`.
    fields:
        - imu_type:
            type: u8
            desc: IMU type
            fields:
              - 0-7:
                  desc: IMU Type
                  values:
                      - 0: Bosch BMI160
        - temp:
            type: s16
            desc: Raw IMU temperature
        - imu_conf:
            type: u8
            desc: IMU configuration
            fields:
              - 4-7:
                  desc: Gyroscope Range
                  values:
                      - 0: +/- 2000 deg / s
                      - 1: +/- 1000 deg / s
                      - 2: +/- 500 deg / s
                      - 3: +/- 250 deg / s
                      - 4: +/- 125 deg / s
              - 0-3:
                  desc: Accelerometer Range
                  values:
                      - 0: +/- 2g
                      - 1: +/- 4g
                      - 2: +/- 8g
