       Metadata describing which sensors were involved in the solution.
       The structure is fixed no matter what the actual sensor type is.
       The sensor_type field tells you which sensor we are talking about. It also tells you
       whether the sensor data was actually used or not.
       The flags field, always a u8, contains the sensor-specific data.
       The content of flags, for each sensor type, is described in the relevant structures in this section.

 - MSG_SOLN_META:

     short_desc: Solution Sensors Metadata
     public: true
     desc: >
       This message contains all metadata about the sensors received and/or used in computing the sensorfusion solution.
       It focuses primarily, but not only, on GNSS metadata.
       Regarding the age of the last received valid GNSS solution, the highest two bits are time status, indicating
       whether age gnss can or can not be used to retrieve time of measurement (noted TOM, also known as time of validity)
       If it can, subtract 'age gnss' from 'tow' in navigation messages to get TOM. Can be used before alignment is
       complete in the Fusion Engine, when output solution is the last received valid GNSS solution and its tow is not a TOM.
