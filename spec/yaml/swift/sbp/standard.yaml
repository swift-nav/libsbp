stable: True
include:
  - types.yaml
definitions:

 - MSG_STARTUP:
    id: 0xFF00
    short_desc: System start-up message
    desc: |
        The system start-up message is sent once on system start-up. It is
        intended to be used to notify the host or other attached devices that
        the system has started and is now ready to respond to commands or
        configuration requests.
    fields:
        - reserved:
            type: u32
            desc: Reserved

 - MSG_HEARTBEAT:
    id: 0xFFFF
    short_desc: System heartbeat message
    desc: |
        The heartbeat message is sent periodically to inform the host or
        other attached devices that the system is running. It is intended to
        be used to monitor for system malfunctions and also contains
        status flags that indicate to the host the status of the system and
        if it is operating correctly.

        The system error flag is used to indicate that an error has occurred in
        the system. To determine the source of the error the remaining error
        flags should be inspected.
    fields:
        - flags:
            type: u32
            desc: Status flags
