## SBP Definitions

This directory contains language-agnostic definitions for structured
messages decoded from Swift Binary Protocol (SBP)
payloads. Language-specific message bindings use the
[YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) specifications defined in
this directory.

The definition schema is quite holistic at this point, but the key
types available in the schema are defined
[`here`](yaml/swiftnav/sbp/types.yaml). To see the key features of the
specification in use, checkout the annotated
[`example`](example/yaml/example.yaml) file.
