 - Doppler:
     short_desc: GNSS doppler measurement
     desc: >
       Doppler measurement in Hz represented as a 24-bit
       fixed point number with Q16.8 layout, i.e. 16-bits of whole
       doppler and 8-bits of fractional doppler. This doppler is defined
       as positive for approaching satellites.
