description: Precise State Space Representation (SSR) corrections format
stable: False
public: True
include:
  - types.yaml
  - gnss.yaml
definitions:
 - MSG_SSR_STEC_CORRECTION:
    id: 0x05FB
    short_desc: STEC correction polynomial coefficients
    desc: >
      The Slant Total Electron Content per space vehicle, given as polynomial
      approximation for a given tile. This should be combined with the
      MSG_SSR_GRIDDED_CORRECTION message to get the state space representation
      of the atmospheric delay.


      It is typically equivalent to the QZSS CLAS Sub Type 8 messages.
    fields:
        - header:
            type: STECHeader
            desc: Header of a STEC polynomial coefficient message.
        - stec_sat_list:
            type: array
            fill: STECSatElement
            desc: Array of STEC polynomial coefficients for each space vehicle.
