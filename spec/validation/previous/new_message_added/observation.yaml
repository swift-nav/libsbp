description: Satellite observation messages from the device.
             The SBP sender ID of 0 indicates remote observations
             from a GNSS base station, correction network, or Skylark,
             Swift's cloud GNSS correction product.

    desc: >
      The GPS observations message reports all the raw pseudorange and
      carrier phase observations for the satellites being tracked by
      the device. Carrier phase observation here is represented as a
      40-bit fixed point number with Q32.8 layout (i.e. 32-bits of
      whole cycles and 8-bits of fractional cycles). The observations
      are be interoperable with 3rd party receivers and conform
      with typical RTCMv3 GNSS observations.
