  Geodetic navigation messages reporting GPS time, position, velocity,
  and baseline position solutions. For position solutions, these
  messages define several different position solutions: single-point
  (SPP), RTK, and pseudo-absolute position solutions.


  The SPP is the standalone, absolute GPS position solution using only
  a single receiver. The RTK solution is the differential GPS
  solution, which can use either a fixed/integer or floating carrier
  phase ambiguity. The pseudo-absolute position solution uses a
  user-provided, well-surveyed base station position (if available)
  and the RTK solution in tandem.


  When the inertial navigation mode indicates that the IMU is used,
  all messages are reported in the vehicle body frame as defined by
  device settings.  By default, the vehicle body frame is configured to be
  coincident with the antenna phase center.  When there is no inertial
  navigation, the solution will be reported at the phase center of the antenna.
  There is no inertial navigation capability on Piksi Multi or Duro.


  The tow field, when valid, is most often the Time of Measurement. When this
  is the case, the 5th bit of flags is set to the default value of 0.
  When this is not the case, the tow may be a time of arrival or a local
  system timestamp, irrespective of the time reference (GPS Week or else),
  but not a Time of Measurement.

    short_desc: GPS Time
    desc: >
      This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
      the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.


      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
      these messages.

      This position solution message reports the absolute geodetic
      coordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK)
      of the position solution. If the rover receiver knows the
      surveyed position of the base station and has an RTK solution,
      this reports a pseudo-absolute position solution using the base
      station position and the rover's RTK baseline vector. The full
      GPS time is given by the preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the
      matching time-of-week (tow).

      measurement and care should be taken with the sign convention.

    short_desc: GNSS-only Geodetic Position
    desc: >
      This position solution message reports the absolute geodetic
      coordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK)
      of the position solution as well as the upper triangle of the 3x3
      covariance matrix.  The position information and Fix Mode flags should
      follow the MSG_POS_LLH message.  Since the covariance matrix is computed
      in the local-level North, East, Down frame, the covariance terms follow
      with that convention. Thus, covariances are reported against the "downward"
      measurement and care should be taken with the sign convention.

      vector. It also includes the vertical velocity coordinate.
      A flag is provided to indicate whether the COG value has been frozen. When 
      the flag is set to true, the COG field is set to its last valid value until 
      the system exceeds a minimum velocity threshold. No other fields are 
      affected by this flag.

      plane centered at the current position. The full GPS time is given by the 
      preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow).
      Note: course over ground represents the receiver's direction of travel, 
      but not necessarily the device heading.

      counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
      Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
      the GPS time scale.


      Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
      between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
      does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
      offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
      set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
      (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
