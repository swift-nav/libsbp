## Specification and Bindings for Swift Binary Protocol

[![Build status][1]][2]

The Swift Navigation Binary Protocol (SBP) is a fast, simple, and
minimal binary protocol for communicating with Swift devices. It is
the native binary protocol used by the
[Piksi GPS receiver](http://swiftnav.com/piksi.html) to transmit
solutions, observations, status and debugging messages, as well as
receive messages from the host operating system, such as differential
corrections and the almanac.

This project provides language-agnostic specification and
documentation for messages used with SBP, a compiler for generating
message bindings, and client libraries in a variety of languages. This
repository is organized into the following directory structure:

* [`docs`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/docs): Protocol documentation and message definitions.
* [`spec`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/spec): Machine readable protocol specification in
  [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
* [`generator`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/generator): Simple, template-based generator for
  different languages.
* [`python`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/python): Python client and examples.
* [`c`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/c): C client library and examples.
* [`haskell`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/haskell): Haskell client and examples.
* [`java`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/java): Java client library and examples.
* [`javascript`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/javascript): JavaScript client library and examples.

Except for the `generator`, all of the above are generated and should not be modified directly.

## Building / installing
### Using Docker

#### Creating your own image

`Dockerfile-build` will create a docker image that contains all the
necessary dependencies to build libsbp.  You can make a local image
fresh from this file by running `docker build` as such:

`mkdir dummy; cd dummy`

This dummy directory is to prevent docker from sucking up the whole
repo into the local context (which is then immediately discarded
anyway).  Next create the docker image:

`docker build -f ../Dockerfile.buster -t your-local-image-name .`

You can then make this image operate on your local workspace like this:

`cd ..`  (back up to the root of the repo)

``docker run  -v `pwd`:/mnt/workspace  -i -t your-local-image-name:latest``

Once in the image, simply type `make all` to gererate all the libsbp bindings.

#### Using the prebuilt one from dockerhub

You can also pull a copy from dockerhub (no guarantees on freshness):

``docker run  -v `pwd`:/mnt/workspace -i -t swiftnav/libsbp-build:2020.01.15``

Check this [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/swiftnav/libsbp-build/tags) for newer tags.

### Installing from package managers
Some bindings are available on package managers:

* [`python`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/python): available on pip
* [`haskell`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/haskell): available on Hackage
* [`javascript`](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/tree/HEAD/javascript): available on NPM

### Installing development Python versions

To install the Python binding from source (using pip) run the following command:

```sh
pip install 'file:///path/to/libsbp#subdirectory=python'
```

Or via setuptools directly:
```sh
cd /path/to/libsbp
cd python
python setup.py
```

### Adding development version as a pip dependency

Run the following command:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp@<GIT_REVISION>#egg=sbp&subdirectory=python
```

Or add this to `requirements.txt`:
```
git+https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp@<GIT_REVISION>#egg=sbp&subdirectory=python
```

### Installing from source
You can build one binding at a time or update all at once:

```
make python
```

or

```
make all
```

are both valid. To see a list of all valid targets, run `make help`.

**Python version notes:**
1. by default the Python targets `make python` and `make test-python`
   (as well as `make all`) run tests on all Python versions officially supported
   by *the libsbp Python bindings*, currently **2.7, 3.5, and 3.7**, skipping
   any versions not installed. To run tests on just specific Python version(s),
   specify the `TOXENV` environment variable, e.g.,
   `TOXENV=py27,py35 make python`. Travis runs Python tests on all supported
   versions.
2. by default *the code generators* are run on the system's (or virtual env's)
   default Python interpreter. Currently Python versions **2.7, 3.5, and 3.7**
   are officially supported, other versions may or may not work. The generated
   libsbp bindings should be the same on all supported Python versions. To use
   a different version than your default Python interpreter, specify the
   `GENENV` environment variable, e.g., `GENENV=py27 make all`
   (you must have that version of Python installed beforehand).
3. to run both the generator and the Python tests on specific Python versions,
   specify both envs, e.g., `GENENV=py37 TOXENV=py27,py37 make python`


## SBP Protocol Specification

SBP consists of two pieces: (i) an over-the-wire message framing
format and (ii) structured payload definitions. As of Version 1.0, the
packet consists of a 6-byte binary header section, a variable-sized
payload field, and a 16-bit CRC value. SBP uses the CCITT CRC16
(XMODEM implementation) for error detection.

Please see
[the docs](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/raw/master/docs/sbp.pdf)
for a full description of the packet structure and the message
types. Developer documentatation for the language-specific sbp
libraries is [here](http://swift-nav.github.io/libsbp/).
Please refer to [the changelog](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for more information about the evolution of the library and its messages.

## JSON Schema Definitions

For web clients processing SBP in JSON form, JSON schema definitions are
provided.  Libraries for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Elm generated by the
[QuickType](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype) tool are provided.  See the
HOWTO for instructions on updating these schemas.
