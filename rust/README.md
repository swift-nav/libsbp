# Rust SBP Bindings
## Building the Rust bindings
From the parent directory, run `make rust` to regenerate the bindings and run all tests.
### Requirements
We require only typical rust tools to be installed when re-generating the bindings. Specifically we require:
 * rustc
 * cargo
 * rustfmt

If you need to install rust please see the section below titled "Installing Rust"

## Installing Rust
If you don't have the rust compiler installed, we recommend installing it via the [rustup script](https://rustup.rs/).
