Messages for reading, writing, and discovering device settings. Settings
with a "string" field have multiple values in this field delimited with a
null character (the c style null terminator).  For instance, when querying
the 'firmware_version' setting in the 'system_info' section, the following
array of characters needs to be sent for the string field in
MSG_SETTINGS_READ: "system_info\0firmware_version\0", where the delimiting 
null characters are specified with the escape sequence '\0' and all
quotation marks should be omitted. 


In the message descriptions below, the generic strings SECTION_SETTING and
SETTING are used to refer to the two strings that comprise the identifier
of an individual setting.In firmware_version example above, SECTION_SETTING
is the 'system_info', and the SETTING portion is 'firmware_version'. 

See the "Software Settings Manual" on support.swiftnav.com for detailed
documentation about all settings and sections available for each Swift
firmware version. Settings manuals are available for each firmware version
at the following link: https://support.swiftnav.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2628580-piksi-multi-specifications#settings.
The latest settings document is also available at the following link: 
http://swiftnav.com/latest/piksi-multi-settings .
See lastly https://github.com/swift-nav/piksi_tools/blob/master/piksi_tools/settings.py , 
the open source python command line utility for reading, writing, and
saving settings in the piksi_tools repository on github as a helpful
reference and example.
