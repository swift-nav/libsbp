class Latency(object):

  Statistics on the latency of observations received from the base
station. As observation packets are received their GPS time is
compared to the current GPS time calculated locally by the
receiver to give a precise measurement of the end-to-end
communication latency in the system.

  
  Parameters
  ----------
  avg : int
    Average latency.
  lmin : int
    Minimum latency.
  lmax : int
    Maximum latency.
  current : int
    Smoothed estimate of the current latency.
