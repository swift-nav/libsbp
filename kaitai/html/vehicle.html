<h2>Type: MsgOdometry</h2>

<p>Message representing the x component of vehicle velocity in the user
frame at the odometry reference point(s) specified by the user. The
offset for the odometry reference point and the definition and origin of
the user frame are defined through the device settings interface. There
are 4 possible user-defined sources of this message which are labeled
arbitrarily source 0 through 3. If using "processor time" time tags, the
receiving end will expect a `MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a PVT fix
becomes available to synchronise odometry measurements with GNSS.
Processor time shall roll over to zero after one week.

<a name='type-vehicle-msg_wheeltick'></a>
<h2>Type: MsgWheeltick</h2>

<p>Message containing the accumulated distance travelled by a wheel located
at an odometry reference point defined by the user. The offset for the
odometry reference point and the definition and origin of the user frame
are defined through the device settings interface. The source of this
message is identified by the source field, which is an integer ranging
from 0 to 255. The timestamp associated with this message should
represent the time when the accumulated tick count reached the value
given by the contents of this message as accurately as possible. If
using "local CPU time" time tags, the receiving end will expect a
`MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a PVT fix becomes available to synchronise
wheeltick measurements with GNSS. Local CPU time shall roll over to zero
after one week.
