 - SBP:
    desc: |
      Defines full packet structure for Swift Navigation Binary Protocol
      (SBP).
    fields:
        - preamble:
            type: u8
            desc: Denotes the start of frame transmission. For v1.0, always 0x55.
        - msg_type:
            type: u16
            desc: ldentifies the payload contents
        - sender:
            type: u16
            desc: |
              A unique identifier of the sending hardware. For v1.0 on Piksi,
              set to the 2 least significant bytes of the Piksi serial.
              number.
        - length:
            type: u8
            desc: Length in bytes of the Payload field.
        - payload:
            type: bytes
            size_fn: length
            desc: |
              Binary data of the message, as identified by Message Type and
              Length. Usually contains the in-memory binary representation of
              a C struct (see documentation on individual message types).
        - crc:
            type: u16
            desc: |
              Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of the packet's binary data from
              the Message Type up to the end of Payload (does not include the
              Preamble).
