  "description":"This message reports the orientation rates in the vehicle body frame. The values represent the measurements a strapped down gyroscope would make and are not equivalent to the time derivative of the Euler angles. The orientation and origin of the user frame is specified via device settings. By convention, the vehicle x-axis is expected to be aligned with the forward direction, while the vehicle y-axis is expected to be aligned with the right direction, and the vehicle z-axis should be aligned with the down direction. This message will only be available in future INS versions of Swift Products and is not produced by Piksi Multi or Duro.\n",
