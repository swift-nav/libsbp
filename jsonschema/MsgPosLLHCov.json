  "description":"This position solution message reports the absolute geodetic,\ncoordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK),\nof the position solution as well as the upper triangle of the 3x3,\ncovariance matrix.  The position information and Fix Mode flags should,\nfollow the MSG_POS_LLH message.  Since the covariance matrix is computed,\nin the local-level North, East, Down frame, the covariance terms follow,\nwith that convention. Thus, covariances are reported against the \"downward\",\nmeasurement and care should be taken with the sign convention.\n",
