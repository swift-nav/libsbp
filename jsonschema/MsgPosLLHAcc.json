  "description":"This position solution message reports the absolute geodetic coordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK) of the position solution as well as the estimated horizontal, vertical, cross-track and along-track errors.,\nThe estimated errors are reported at a user-configurable confidence level. The user-configured percentile is encoded in the percentile field.,\nThe position information and Fix Mode flags should follow the MSG_POS_LLH message. Since the covariance matrix is computed in the local-level North, East, Down frame, the estimated error terms follow with that convention.\n",
