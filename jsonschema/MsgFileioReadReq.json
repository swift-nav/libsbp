  "description":"The file read message reads a certain length (up to 255 bytes) from a given offset into a file, and returns the data in a MSG_FILEIO_READ_RESP message where the message length field indicates how many bytes were successfully read. The sequence number in the request will be returned in the response. If the message is invalid, a followup MSG_PRINT message will print \"Invalid fileio read message\". A device will only respond to this message when it is received from sender ID 0x42.\n",
