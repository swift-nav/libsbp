  "description":"Message representing the x component of vehicle velocity in the user frame at the odometry reference point(s) specified by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and the definition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface. There are 4 possible user-defined sources of this message which are labeled arbitrarily source 0 through 3. If using \"processor time\" time tags, the receiving end will expect a `MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a PVT fix becomes available to synchronise odometry measurements with GNSS. Processor time shall roll over to zero after one week.\n",
