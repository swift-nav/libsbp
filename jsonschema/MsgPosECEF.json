  "description":"The position solution message reports absolute Earth Centered,\nEarth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates and the status (single point vs,\npseudo-absolute RTK) of the position solution. If the rover,\nreceiver knows the surveyed position of the base station and has,\nan RTK solution, this reports a pseudo-absolute position,\nsolution using the base station position and the rover's RTK,\nbaseline vector. The full GPS time is given by the preceding,\nMSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow).\n",
