  "description":"The position solution message reports absolute Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK) of the position solution. The message also reports the upper triangular portion of the 3x3 covariance matrix. If the receiver knows the surveyed position of the base station and has an RTK solution, this reports a pseudo-absolute position solution using the base station position and the rover's RTK baseline vector. The full GPS time is given by the preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow).\n",
