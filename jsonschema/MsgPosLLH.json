If the rover receiver knows the,\nsurveyed position of the base station and has an RTK solution,,\nthis reports a pseudo-absolute position solution using the base,\nstation position and the rover's RTK baseline vector. The full,\nGPS time is given by the preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the,\nmatching time-of-week (tow).\n",
