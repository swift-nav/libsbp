  "description":"The position solution message reports absolute Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates and the status (single point vs pseudo-absolute RTK) of the position solution. If the rover receiver knows the surveyed position of the base station and has an RTK solution, this reports a pseudo-absolute position solution using the base station position and the rover's RTK baseline vector. The full GPS time is given by the preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow).\n",
