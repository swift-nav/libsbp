  "description":"Message containing the accumulated distance travelled by a wheel located at an odometry,\nreference point defined by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and the,\ndefinition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface.,\nThe source of this message is identified by the source field, which is an integer ranging,\nfrom 0 to 255.,\nThe timestamp associated with this message should represent the time when the accumulated,\ntick count reached the value given by the contents of this message as accurately as possible.,\nIf using \"local CPU time\" time tags, the receiving end will expect a,\n`MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a PVT fix becomes available to synchronise wheeltick measurements,\nwith GNSS.\n",
