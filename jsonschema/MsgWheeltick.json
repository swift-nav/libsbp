  "description":"Message containing the accumulated distance travelled by a wheel located at an odometry reference point defined by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and the definition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface. The source of this message is identified by the source field, which is an integer ranging from 0 to 255. The timestamp associated with this message should represent the time when the accumulated tick count reached the value given by the contents of this message as accurately as possible. If using \"local CPU time\" time tags, the receiving end will expect a `MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET` when a PVT fix becomes available to synchronise wheeltick measurements with GNSS. Local CPU time shall roll over to zero after one week.\n",
