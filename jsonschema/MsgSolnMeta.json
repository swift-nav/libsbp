  "description":"This message contains all metadata about the sensors received and/or used in computing the sensorfusion solution.,\nIt focuses primarly, but not only, on GNSS metadata. Re. the age of the last received valid GNSS solution,,\nthe highest two bits are Time status, which indicates whether age gnss can or can not be used,\nto retrieve time of measurement (noted TOM, aka time of validity), i.e. to be used in conjuction with,\nthe tow field of other navigation messages. If it can be used (value 1), substract from tow in,\nnavigation message to retrieve the time of measurement. Useful before alignment is complete in,\nthe Fusion Engine, when outputted solution is the last received valid GNSS solution and its tow,\nis not that of Time Of Measurement.\n",
