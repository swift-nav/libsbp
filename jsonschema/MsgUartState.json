  "description":"The UART message reports data latency and throughput of the UART channels providing SBP I/O. On the default Piksi configuration, UARTs A and B are used for telemetry radios, but can also be host access ports for embedded hosts, or other interfaces in future. The reported percentage values must be normalized. Observations latency and period can be used to assess the health of the differential corrections link. Latency provides the timeliness of received base observations while the period indicates their likelihood of transmission.\n",
