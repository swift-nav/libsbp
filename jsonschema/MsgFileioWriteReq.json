  "description":"The file write message writes a certain length (up to 255 bytes) of data to a file at a given offset. Returns a copy of the original MSG_FILEIO_WRITE_RESP message to check integrity of the write. The sequence number in the request will be returned in the response. If message is invalid, a followup MSG_PRINT message will print \"Invalid fileio write message\". A device will only process this message when it is received from sender ID 0x42.\n",
