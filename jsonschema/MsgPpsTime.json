  "description":"The PPS time message contains the value of the sender's local time in,\nmicroseconds at the moment a pulse is detected on the PPS input. This,\nis to be used for syncronisation of sensor data sampled with a local,\ntimestamp (e.g. IMU or wheeltick messages) where GNSS time is unknown,\nto the sender.,\n,\nThe local time used to timestamp the PPS pulse must be generated by the,\nsame clock which is used to timestamp the IMU/wheel sensor data and,\nshould follow the same roll-over rules.  A separate MSG_PPS_TIME,\nmessage should be sent for each source of sensor data which uses,\nPPS-relative timestamping.  The sender ID for each of these,\nMSG_PPS_TIME messages should match the sender ID of the respective,\nsensor data.\n",
