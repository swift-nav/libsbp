  "description":"The PPS time message contains the value of the sender's local time in microseconds at the moment a pulse is detected on the PPS input. This is to be used for syncronisation of sensor data sampled with a local timestamp (e.g. IMU or wheeltick messages) where GNSS time is unknown to the sender.,\n,\nThe local time used to timestamp the PPS pulse must be generated by the same clock which is used to timestamp the IMU/wheel sensor data and should follow the same roll-over rules.  A separate MSG_PPS_TIME message should be sent for each source of sensor data which uses PPS-relative timestamping.  The sender ID for each of these MSG_PPS_TIME messages should match the sender ID of the respective sensor data.\n",
