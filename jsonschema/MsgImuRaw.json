  "description":"Raw data from the Inertial Measurement Unit, containing accelerometer and gyroscope readings. The sense of the measurements are to be aligned with the indications on the device itself. Measurement units, which are specific to the device hardware and settings, are communicated via the MSG_IMU_AUX message. If using \"time since startup\" local time tags, the receiving end will expect a `MSG_PPS_TIME` regardless of GNSS fix state. This also requires that the MSG_PPS_TIME message be sent prior to any IMU RAW messages that are based on the current (as measured at the PPS edge) local time timestamps. The local time (as defined in the MSG_PPS_TIME message) must wrap around to zero when reaching the extent of the u64 \"Local time in microseconds\" parameter.,\nThe time-tagging mode should not change throughout a run.\n",
