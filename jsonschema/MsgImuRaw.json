  "description":"Raw data from the Inertial Measurement Unit, containing accelerometer and gyroscope readings. The sense of the measurements are to be aligned with the indications on the device itself. Measurement units, which are specific to the device hardware and settings, are communicated via the MSG_IMU_AUX message. If using \"time since startup\" local time tags, the receiving end will expect either a MSG_GNSS_TIME_OFFSET or MSG_PPS_TIME to establish the relationship between IMU time and GNSS time.,\nRegardless of the timestamping mode, the timestamp is required to roll over to zero when reaching one week (604800 seconds, or 604800000 milliseconds).,\nThe time-tagging mode should not change throughout a run.\n",
