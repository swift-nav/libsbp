  "description":"This message reports the velocity in the Vehicle Body Frame. By convention, the x-axis should point out the nose of the vehicle and represent the forward direction, while as the y-axis should point out the right hand side of the vehicle. Since this is a right handed system, z should point out the bottom of the vehicle. The orientation and origin of the Vehicle Body Frame are specified via the device settings. The full GPS time is given by the preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow). This message is only produced by inertial versions of Swift products and is not available from Piksi Multi or Duro.\n",
