  "description":"This message reports the receiver course over ground (COG) and speed over  ground (SOG) based on the horizontal (N-E) components of the NED velocity  vector. It also includes the vertical velocity coordinate. A flag is provided to indicate whether the COG value has been frozen. When  the flag is set to true, the COG field is set to its last valid value until  the system exceeds a minimum velocity threshold. No other fields are  affected by this flag.  The NED coordinate system is defined as the local WGS84 tangent  plane centered at the current position. The full GPS time is given by the  preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow). Note: course over ground represents the receiver's direction of travel,  but not necessarily the device heading.\n",
