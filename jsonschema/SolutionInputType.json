  "description":"Metadata describing which sensors were involved in the solution. The structure is fixed no matter what the actual sensor type is. The sensor_type field tells you which sensor we are talking about. It also tells you whether the sensor data was actually used or not. The flags field, always a u8, contains the sensor-specific data. The content of flags, for each sensor type, is described in the relevant structures in this section.\n",
