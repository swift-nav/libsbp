 *  * Messages for using device's onboard flash filesystem
 * functionality. This allows data to be stored persistently in the
 * device's program flash with wear-levelling using a simple filesystem
 * interface. The file system interface (CFS) defines an abstract API
 * for reading directories and for reading and writing files.
 * 
 * These are in the implementation-defined range (0x0000-0x00FF), and
 * intended for internal-use only. Note that some of these messages
 * share the same message type ID for both the host request and the
 * device response.
