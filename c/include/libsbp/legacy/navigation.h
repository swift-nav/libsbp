/** \defgroup navigation Navigation
 *
 * Geodetic navigation messages reporting GPS time, position, velocity, and
 * baseline position solutions. For position solutions, these messages define
 * several different position solutions: single-point (SPP), RTK, and pseudo-
 * absolute position solutions.
 *
 * The SPP is the standalone, absolute GPS position solution using only a
 * single receiver. The RTK solution is the differential GPS solution, which
 * can use either a fixed/integer or floating carrier phase ambiguity. The
 * pseudo-absolute position solution uses a user-provided, well-surveyed base
 * station position (if available) and the RTK solution in tandem.
 *
 * When the inertial navigation mode indicates that the IMU is used, all
 * messages are reported in the vehicle body frame as defined by device
 * settings.  By default, the vehicle body frame is configured to be
 * coincident with the antenna phase center.  When there is no inertial
 * navigation, the solution will be reported at the phase center of the
 * antenna. There is no inertial navigation capability on Piksi Multi or Duro.
 *
 * The tow field, when valid, is most often the Time of Measurement. When this
 * is the case, the 5th bit of flags is set to the default value of 0. When
 * this is not the case, the tow may be a time of arrival or a local system
 * timestamp, irrespective of the time reference (GPS Week or else), but not a
 * Time of Measurement.
