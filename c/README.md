## SBP Bindings for C

libsbp provides C bindings for Swift Binary Protocol (SBP), used
primarily in [libswiftnav](https://github.com/swift-nav/libswiftnav)
and [piksi_firmware](https://github.com/swift-nav/piksi_firmware). It
is intended to be as portable as possible and is written in standards
compliant C with no dependencies other than the standard C libraries.

## Installation

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu 12.10 or later) you can get
them with:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake
```

On other systems, you can obtain CMake from your operating system
package manager or from http://www.cmake.org/.

Once you have the dependencies installed, From the libsbp root
directory, create a build directory where the library will be built:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
```

Then invoke CMake to configure the build, and then build and install,

```shell
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

By default libsbp will be built both as a shared library `libsbp` and
a static library `libsbp-static`.

## Usage

```c
